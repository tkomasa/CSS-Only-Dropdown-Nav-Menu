# CSS-Only-Dropdown-Nav-Menu
This is a CSS and HTML only dropdown menu, for those that want to avoid JavaScript and rely only on CSS. Just stick to the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags for all your items in the HTML side of things and the css handles it. If you want a seperately styled footer, using unordered lists as well, just give the `<ul>` header tags classes and direct target the classes instead of the tags. I have tried to make the comments on the CSS as clear and concise as I can.
  
Use this literally anyway you want. Thank you!
